    "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a type of neural network that are commonly used for image classification tasks. A CNN is made up of multiple layers. The first layer is typically a convolutional layer which applies filters to the input image to extract features. These filters, also known as kernels, are small matrices that slide over the input image and perform a mathematical operation called convolution. This process helps the network learn the important features in the image, such as edges, corners, and textures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the convolutional layer is then passed through a non-linear activation function, such as ReLU, to introduce non-linearity to the network. This is followed by pooling layers, which reduce the dimensionality of the feature maps and help in preventing overfitting. The most common type of pooling is max pooling, where the maximum value in each local region of the feature map is selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "After several layers of convolution, activation, and pooling, the feature maps are flattened and fed into one or more fully connected layers, which produce the final classification or regression output.\n",
    "\n",
    "CNNs are very powerful because they are able to automatically learn the important features of an image without the need for manual feature engineering. They are widely used in a variety of computer vision tasks, such as object detection, image segmentation, and facial recognition.\n"
